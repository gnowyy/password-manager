# password-manager
just a small practise
main.py:
check?(Y/N) mean check the data with the key
status?(Y/N) mean continue add data or not
if N will ask you to input you account password and what do you want to call it
ac=account
pw=password
name= you can call it what ever you want but when you want to search the corresponding ac and pw you need to enter exactly the same
i know this code is very bad but i don't want to think a way to avoid these annoying flow control
i just make some thing to learn python :)
json file is just to save the data
