# password-manager
just a small practise
main.py:
check?(Y/N) mean check the data with the key
if N will ask you to input you account password and what do you want to call it
ac=account
pw=password
name= you can call it what ever you want but when you want to search the corresponding ac and pw you need to enter exactly the same

json file is just to save the data
